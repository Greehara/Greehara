Yo I'm known as Greehara on most platforms and I've joined GitHub to create and manage a rhythm game in Godot 4.2
I don't have much to say on my project right now, but I may release a public repository so you can try out what I've done so far in the future.

<!---
Greehara/Greehara is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
